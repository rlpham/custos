/**
 * A mutation describes a self-contained change to a document. Mutations can

 * the existing version for Set, Patch, and Transform mutations. For Delete
 * mutations, we reset the version to 0.
 *
 * Here's the expected transition table.
 *
 * MUTATION           APPLIED TO            RESULTS IN
 *
 * SetMutation        Document(v3)          Document(v3)

 * SetMutation        null                  Document(v0)
 * PatchMutation      Document(v3)          Document(v3)
 * PatchMutation      NoDocument(v3)        NoDocument(v3)
 * PatchMutation      null                  null
 * TransformMutation  Document(v3)          Document(v3)
 * TransformMutation  NoDocument(v3)        NoDocument(v3)
 * TransformMutation  null                  null
 * DeleteMutation     Document(v3)          NoDocument(v0)

 * DeleteMutation     null                  NoDocument(v0)
 *
 * For acknowledged mutations, we use the updateTime of the WriteResponse as
 * the resulting version for Set, Patch, and Transform mutations. As deletes
 * have no explicit update time, we use the commitTime of the WriteResponse for
 * Delete mutations.
 *
 * If a mutation is acknowledged by the backend but fails the precondition check
 * locally, we return an `UnknownDocument` and rely on Watch to send us the
 * updated version.
 *
 * Note that TransformMutations don't create Documents (in the case of being
 * applied to a NoDocument), even though they would on the backend. This is
 * because the client always combines the TransformMutation with a SetMutation
 * or PatchMutation and we only want to apply the transform if the prior
 * mutation resulted in a Document (always true for a SetMutation, but not
 * necessarily for a PatchMutation).
 *
 * ## Subclassing Notes

 * Subclasses of Mutation need to implement applyToRemoteDocument() and
 * applyToLocalView() to implement the actual behavior of applying the mutation
 * to some source document.

/**
 * Local storage in the Firestore client. Coordinates persistence components
 * like the mutation queue and remote document cache to present a
 * latency-compensated view of stored data.
 *
 * The LocalStore is responsible for accepting mutations from the Sync Engine.
 * Writes from the client are put into a queue as provisional Mutations until
 * they are processed by the RemoteStore and confirmed as having been written
 * to the server.
 *
 * The local store provides the local version of documents that have been
 * modified locally. It maintains the constraint:
 *
 *   LocalDocument = RemoteDocument + Active(LocalMutations)
 *
 * (Active mutations are those that are enqueued and have not been previously
 * acknowledged or rejected).
 *
 * The RemoteDocument ("ground truth") state is provided via the
 * applyChangeBatch method. It will be some version of a server-provided
 * document OR will be a server-provided document PLUS acknowledged mutations:
 *
 *   RemoteDocument' = RemoteDocument + Acknowledged(LocalMutations)
 *
 * Note that this "dirty" version of a RemoteDocument will not be identical to a
 * server base version, since it has LocalMutations added to it pending getting
 * an authoritative copy from the server.
 *
 * Since LocalMutations can be rejected by the server, we have to be able to
 * revert a LocalMutation that has already been applied to the LocalDocument
 * (typically done by replaying all remaining LocalMutations to the
 * RemoteDocument to re-apply).
 *
 * The LocalStore is responsible for the garbage collection of the documents it
 * contains. For now, it every doc referenced by a view, the mutation queue, or
 * the RemoteStore.
 *
 * It also maintains the persistence of mapping queries to resume tokens and
 * target ids. It needs to know this data about queries to properly know what
 * docs it would be allowed to garbage collect.
 *
 * The LocalStore must be able to efficiently execute queries against its local
 * cache of the documents, to provide the initial set of results before any
 * remote changes have been received.
 *
 * Note: In TypeScript, most methods return Promises since the implementation
 * may rely on fetching data from IndexedDB which is async.
 * These Promises will only be rejected on an I/O error or other internal
 * (unexpected) failure (e.g. failed assert) and always represent an
 * unrecoverable error (should be caught / reported by the async_queue).

/**
 * A PersistentStream is an abstract base class that represents a streaming RPC
 * to the Firestore backend. It's built on top of the connections own support
 * for streaming RPCs, and adds several critical features for our clients:
 *
 *   - Exponential backoff on failure
 *   - Authentication via CredentialsProvider
 *   - Dispatching all callbacks into the shared worker queue
 *   - Closing idle streams after 60 seconds of inactivity
 *
 * Subclasses of PersistentStream implement serialization of models to and
 * from the JSON representation of the protocol buffers for a specific
 * streaming RPC.
 *
 * ## Starting and Stopping
 *
 * Streaming RPCs are stateful and need to be start()ed before messages can
 * be sent and received. The PersistentStream will call the onOpen() function
 * of the listener once the stream is ready to accept requests.
 *
 * Should a start() fail, PersistentStream will call the registered onClose()
 * listener with a FirestoreError indicating what went wrong.
 *
 * A PersistentStream can be started and stopped repeatedly.
 *
 * Generic types:
 *  SendType: The type of the outgoing message of the underlying
 *    connection stream
 *  ReceiveType: The type of the incoming message of the underlying
 *    connection stream
 *  ListenerType: The type of the listener that will be used for callbacks
